<!-- ## Installation

Open the Julia REPL, then

```
julia> # type ] to open package manager

pkg> add https://github.com/Alexander-Reimer/Simulation-of-MNNs
```

This should install the MNN package and all dependencies automatically.

### NixOS

When using NixOS, activating the development shell is necessary to make GLMakie work:

```bash
cd /path/to/this/project
nix-shell .
```

## Usage

To use MNN.jl in you project, you should first import it with

```julia
using MNN
```

You can then create your first MNN (see [`MNN.get_user_behaviour`](@ref) for
instructions on how to use the GUI):

```julia
# create a MNN  with 5 columns and 4 rows
net = Network(5, 4) 
# show the network
vis = Visualizer(net)
# create a behaviour to simulate using a GUI
b = get_user_behaviour(network::Network)
# simulate network with forces determined by b applied for 500 time steps
simulate!(net, Diff(500), b, vis = vis)
```
